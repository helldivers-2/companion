      <br />
      In Helldivers, the player needs to coordinate their actions during chaotic
      combat to complete objectives and avoid friendly fire casualties.[6] The
      game pits the players against three different enemy species and tasks them
      with ensuring the survival of Super Earth. Players engage with
      procedurally generated missions where players must accomplish a series of
      objectives. At the start of each mission, players can choose their
      loadouts (sets of weapons, equipment, and gear) and deployment positions.
      They can also use the game&apos;s stratagem mechanic to enhance their options,
      catering to the map layout or their individual playstyle. For example, the
      player may choose stratagems that focus on providing additional firepower
      or mobility, or give themselves supportive abilities such as calling in
      precise airstrikes.

      <br />
      The game has a single difficulty option, though the player can then choose
      a hard or easy planet for their missions. This changed over the course of
      development.

      <br />
      In each mission, the player must fight or sneak through enemy-controlled
      territory to complete the given objectives, then escape via a dropship. It
      is possible to fail some of the given objectives without immediately
      losing. It often benefits the player to avoid direct combat if possible,
      as the enemy has infinite reinforcements, and there are no in-game rewards
      for simply killing enemies.
      <br />
      <br />
      The game keeps many of the mechanics common to the genre, like Fog of War
      and a map that shows any enemies the player(s) can currently see. The
      enemy will patrol their territory, impeding the player&apos;s attempt to
      complete the given objectives. Enemy units that come in contact with the
      player(s) will try to raise an alarm, which will result in continuous
      waves of enemy reinforcements for as long as the alarm remains active. The
      player can prevent an alarm by avoiding enemy patrols if possible, and can
      cancel one by defeating all units currently aware of the player or by
      fleeing the area.

      Once all mission objectives are successfully completed or failed, the
      player is then required to call in a dropship and escape with all their
      remaining units. This takes 90 seconds and draws enemy attention to the
      landing zone, resulting in heavy fighting. Entering the dropship completes
      the mission.
