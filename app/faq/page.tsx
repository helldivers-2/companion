                  In Helldivers 2, Super Earth is in a Galactic War with the
                  Automatons (robots) and the Terminids (bugs). During gameplay,
                  you can choose to either attack the robots or the bugs. There
                  are roughly 8-12 planets at any given time that you are
                  allowed to play on, with the ultimate goal of liberating the
                  planets and restoring democracy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Galactic War status is global among all Helldivers
                  players, and each and every Helldiver player victory
                  contributes to liberating planets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This site shows all of the planets that you can play on at any
                  given time, whether to Liberate or Defend the planet from an
                  attack. In addition, it shows the current Liberation progress
                  as well as an estimated time for the planet to be complete
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the top of the site is a brief overview of the main movers
                  in the Galactic War
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you click on a planet in the table, you can see the
                  history.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the map, there are pins for each active planet that
                  includes its liberation status as well as the rate of
                  liberation.

                How does the math behind Liberation work?
              </h3>
              <div>
                <ul className="list-outside list-disc pl-4">
                  <li>
                    Each planet has an internal max HP. When attacking, the
                    planet has 1000000. When defending, this varies from
                    600k-~2mil.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Each planet regens HP, usually ranging from 1.5% to 4.5% per
                    hour, but has been seen as high as 20% per hour. The game
                    master can change these values at any time. NOTE - defense
                    campaign doesn&apos;t regen hp, it is purely timer based
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Each Operation a Helldiver completes deals damage to the
                    planet.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The automatons can also drop a giant nuke on planets to
                    deplete some liberation. This can be seen on planets such as{" "}
                    <a href="/Planets/tien-kwan">Tien Kwan</a>. These drastic
                    dips in liberation have been 1-2%, occuring as much as 5-10
                    times to keep Super Earth at bay.

                  Does abandoning an operation negatively impact the %?
                </h3>
                <p>No, it does not.</p>

                  Why do all the planets seem to reset their status everyday?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Bugs and bots DO NOT sleep, they are constantly pushing back
                  (hp regen). So overnight, when Americans (the biggest player
                  base) are sleeping, the bugs and bots take back a lot of the
                  planet. See the 2nd bullet in how Liberation math works.

                  What is the deal with &quot;Other Planets&quot;?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  This is people who are playing the game as an individual, and
                  are having very little impact to the galactic war. They are
                  dealing less damage than the planet regens health, so
                  it&apos;s constantly at full health. NOTE - the game master
                  can account for this, so they aren&apos;t negatively impacting
                  the userbase.
